# Art for House 🎨

**Art for House** is a mobile application built with **Expo + React Native** that allows users to try artworks directly in their interior using a phone camera or a photo.

This project is part of my learning and portfolio journey as a front-end / mobile developer. The main focus is UI/UX, gestures, performance and real-world app structure.
